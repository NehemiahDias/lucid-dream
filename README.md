# Lucid Dream Site

This is a React application used to learn about or even achieve Lucid Dreaming. 

## Problem
My interest in lucid dreaming started when I was around 8 years old and have been trying to achieve it since then. Lucid dreaming is when you are aware that you are dreaming, in order to do that, you need to practice using various methods. This site creates the possibility of practicing and building your mental awareness and dream recall. I decided to create this site to help me and anyone else with their lucid dreaming journey!

## Features
The user will be able to sign in/up and write their dreams down in the sites built in dream journal feature. The user is given the ability to add 'tags' to their dream such as lucid, nightmare, vivid, etc. The user is also able to create their own tags. This is done so the user has the ability to filter their dreams and only read dreams they want to read. There will also be a reality check feature which will send you a notification reminding you to do a reality check throughout the day, building mental awareness. The final feature is a social media aspect called 'The Dream Wall' where users are given the ability to share their dreams or experience to all users using the site.
