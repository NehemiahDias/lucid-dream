# Lucid Dream Site

This is a React application used to learn about or even achieve Lucid Dreaming. 

## Features

The user will be able to sign in and write their dreams down like a dream journal. The written dream will be able to be marked as a lucid dream or a normal dream, this way the user is able to track the amount of lucid dreams they've had. There will also be a reality check feature that will send you a notification reminding you to do a reality check throughout the day. 

The user will also be able to receive info and resources that will help them on their dream journey. There will be multiple guides either written into the app or linked out to an article/tutorial. 

The user will be able to post their dreams, methods, or questions on a post feature. People can like or comment on the post.
